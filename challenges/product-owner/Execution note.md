Many tasks in the roadmap are prereqisites for other tasks, which is why they are ordered the way they are.
For some tasks (Eg. the website wireframe) should be done quickly, so that the next person on the team can start
working on their task.
You can still work on those blocking tickets afterwards, but they don't need to be perfectly polished just for the
next dev in line.

About testing, before closing any PR:s involving code ask me or one of the other devs test the feature and review
the code. Since our team size is limited, the code review and QA can be done by the same person. Don't merge anything
before you get a LGTM from someone else.
